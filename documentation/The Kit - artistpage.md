# The Kit - On the Road with the fans
##

The Kit is a DJ duo of two girls. The band is touring heavily and they want a site that si like a meeting place for fans. 
Their fanbase is growing rapidly as they tour the world and their spectacular shows are becoming infamous among fans.
A page where listeners can discover them, a fan page where fans can follow them, stay updated, buy merch or support them
on channels like Mix-cloud (a sort of youtube for DJs where artists earn money from subscribers).

Fans will come back to the site to stay updated on whatÂ´s happening - so the news section
is where they will find recent tour photos - some taken by fans, comments from fans, upcoming releases and exclusive
content not found anywhere else. The client want the site to look good with high quality photos
preferably live photos from shows they had.

## Features


**Zoom feature**


Prior to starting build of the site I did some research on similar artists webpages and found a
style I liked where the background on all pages consist of high-res photos that will start to zoom in
once the visitor opens the page.
[Reference website: Carl Cox](https://carlcox.com/)
Using media query the same effect could be possible on smaller devices.
I also liked the style of menu from Carl Cox site on mobile devices so that was something I tried
to incorporate in the build.
Its an effective yet tasteful way to present photos for the user. As these photos are from live shows
the goal is to get the users more interested in visiting a show.

The page consist of 4 pages, they are accesscible through the navigation bar at the top of each page.
The pages are:
+

**The Navbar**
This is a fully responsive navigation that appears on every page. On the intro page the logo appears bigger and stationed on the left side for a more effectful display of the background image. On the intro page the logo has a text beneath it displaying where the next show will be. The logo act as a return to homepage in the navabr.

**Next show**
As the user enters the site they will see the navbar and the logo. If the user hovers over the logo a dropdown
list will appear informing about the next 5 upcoming shows (date and location).

**Heavy maintance**
A site like this would be rather maintance heavy. As this site in a live setting would need to be constantly updated
with news, fan mail, merch and photos from recent shows.

## Design

Below are my initial wireframes for the sites main page. I wanted the main page to have a large area for photos, so I
thought a transparent navigation bar would be good on this page. Although carefull not causing this to inflict difficulty navigating the site I decided to use black fonts on a light background.

The navbar from the outset was supposed to have non-transparent bakground and I wanted to use the bands logo as a home button in the navbar. I designed the logo myself using the app photoleaps design function on my iphone.

I wanted to use red in my pallette and found this pallette to use.
