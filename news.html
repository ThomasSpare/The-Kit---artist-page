            <h2>OUR NEW RELEASE "ZERO" OUT NOW !</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5orXIakLkSIQAi9XsHOWEb?si=k2ZI6e4eTNauy5KKjgsQ8g" target="_blank";><img

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Krewella is a name unanimously recognizable in and out of dance music, and yet, 
              they haven't released much new music, or gone on tour, in nearly three years. 
              That changed this year, when the new iteration of the group released their first 
              album as a duo made up of Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf. While Krewella has always a 
              been female forward, dance music meets pop operation, the release of zer0 marked 
              a refreshed and newly energized reentrance into the world, focused on its members' 
              cultural histories and how it has informed their relationship with music.<br>
              <br>
              zer0 debuted in January, where it charted across iTunes charts and the like. 
              In March, it received its seemingly first round of remixes. Now, while it's 
              still lingering in our heads, the Yousaf sisters have given us a deeper glimpse 
              into their latest album in their own words. Though they've had to cancel their 
              coordinating tour dates – also their first solo headlining tour in three years 
              – we are sure they will be back out on the road once restrictions are lifted and 
              concerts and festivals can safely resume around the world. For now, the picture 
              that the duo paints can simmer until that live show brings it to life.</p>
